# FireEmissionsEstimate
Progressively make public R code and scripts for estimating fire emission enhancement ratios and emission factors.
Initially this will have scientist explorer code that has been roughly checked. The intention is to make it easier to read progressively. There will likely be a split into estimation code, helpers code, and ER relationships and graphics code. When there is a non-negative matrix factorization, it is likely that changes in seed will make the code irreproducible in very fine detail, but reproducible from a larger perspective.
